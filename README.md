# Investigation-of-model-fusion-techniques-in-few-short-learnings


## Description
This is a simple project that demonstrates how to write a README file.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

1. **main.py**: This file serves as the entry point to your project. It may contain code for orchestrating the execution of the preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.

2. **preprocess.py**: This file contains code for preprocessing the dataset. It may include functions for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for training and testing the model.

3. **model.py**: This file contains the definition of machine learning model and fusion model architectures. It include the architecture of the model, such as layers, activation functions, and optimization techniques.

4. **ModelSaver.py**: This file contains code for saving trained models. It provide a function as callback function and could be used during model fitting.

5. **hyperparameters.py**: This file contains the hyperparameters used for our project, including image size, learning rate, epochs, etc.
